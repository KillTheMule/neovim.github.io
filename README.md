# Neovim's Website (0.1.0 work-in-progress)

**Vim's rebirth for the 21st century**

Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor vim source code in
order to achieve the following goals:

* Simplify maintenance to improve the speed that bug fixes and features get
merged.
* Split the work between multiple developers.
* Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any
modifications to the core source.
* Improve the extensibility power with a new plugin architecture based on
coprocesses. Plugins will be written in any programming language without any
explicit support from the editor.
* By achieving those goals new developers will soon join the community,
consequently improving the editor for all users.

This repository is for the project's website; visit
[Neovim's repository](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) for more details on
the project itself.
